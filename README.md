# My First Portfolio Project

## Objective
The goal is to build a message generator program that produces a new, randomized output each time a user interacts with it.

## Implementation
To achieve this objective, I used HTML and CSS to design a simple input form page. This allows users to submit any question, triggering a random message generated by JavaScript.

## JavaScript Message Generator
- The message generator is structured as an object containing nested arrays.
- Each key within the object holds an array of themed messages.

## Random Message Generation
- A random message is created using the `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()` methods to generate a random index from 0 to 2.
- The output message consists of three parts:
  1. A randomly selected message
  2. A randomly chosen conjunction (AND, BUT, OR)
  3. Another randomly selected message

## Final Product
By integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have successfully developed a 'virtual mentor' page. Here, users can pose a question, and in response, a relevant random message pops up, simulating an answer from a virtual mentor.
